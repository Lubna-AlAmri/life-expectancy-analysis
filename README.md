# Life Expectancy Analysis

This repository contains a mini-project submitted as part of my course. The project explores factors affecting life expectancy across 157 countries using statistical methods and R programming.

## Project Contents

- **Life_expectancy_MiniProject.pdf**: The final report of the project, including methodology, analysis, and findings.
- **Code Snippets**: R code used to perform data analysis and visualization.
- **Dataset**: `life_expectancy_data.csv` obtained from the World Bank.

## Analysis Overview

1. **Objective**: To analyze the impact of different variables like GDP, fertility rate, and vaccination rates on life expectancy.
2. **Methodology**:
   - Scatterplots for visualizing relationships.
   - Linear regression models to identify significant predictors.
   - Variance inflation factors (VIF) to assess multicollinearity.

## Key Findings

- Higher GDP per capita positively correlates with life expectancy.
- Higher fertility rates are associated with lower life expectancy.
- Vaccination rates significantly improve life expectancy.
